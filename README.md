# Python Clean Architecture Example

This project is a sample Python web application adapting Clean Architecture. By using typing module, development experience similar to static type language is achieved.

Dependency injection and Dependency inversion principle, which are the representative features in Clean Architecture, can be implemented without difficulties.

In order to experience the separation of concerning and improvement of testability by Clean Architecture along with the high productivity by Python language, I've published this sample project.

Also in `tests` directory, there are some test samples with partial mock. If you are interested, please take a look it.

# How to run

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements/requirements
$ python -m flask run
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
